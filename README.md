## Introduction:
  
  We've built a range of mind controlled toys and computer games.

As per a recent study conducted by Microsoft using EEG and a lot of fancy tech, the average attention span of a goldfish is 9 seconds, whereas the average attention span of a human is, wait for it, 8 seconds. One second less than that of a goldfish. We are in an existential crisis and it is high time we act upon our declining attention spans. Our inability to focus on a particular thing for longer than a few, sorry 8 seconds has a snowballing effect on everything we do leading to many drastic and severe consequences.
  
According to a survey conducted by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011, More than 1 in 10 (11%) US school-aged children had received an ADHD diagnosis by a health care provider by 2011. With 55.5 million students that is over 6 million in the US only. ADHD is a chronic condition marked by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and sometimes impulsivity. ADHD begins in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Despite the large affected number, there exists no effective treatment for this chronic disorder. Of the currently available methods for treatment, most medicines have side effects varying from moderate inconvenience to potentially life-threatening. Doctors prescribe various exercises as well, which does not ever seem to have more than a marginal effect.

These issues of attention and focus are growing among the youth, and cannot keep up with the fast-paced education system. ADHD, ADD, and just general difficulty with focus is not supported by schooling and viewed as an illness needing to be treated by medication.
However, If channeled properly, this energy is a superpower! The root cause of the problem lies in how people perceive it. The biggest issue with learning disorders and lack of development in methods of treating them is due to the “barrier” it creates in a person's education and the need for medication.
