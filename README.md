## Introduction:
  As per a recent study conducted by Microsoft using EEG and a lot of fancy tech, the average attention span of a goldfish is 9 seconds, whereas the average attention span of a human is, wait for it, 8 seconds. One second less than that of a goldfish. We are in an existential crisis and it is high time we act upon our declining attention spans. Our inability to focus on a particular thing for longer than a few, sorry 8 seconds has a snowballing effect on everything we do leading to many drastic and severe consequences.
